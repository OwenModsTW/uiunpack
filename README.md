uiunpack

Basic repackaging of the UI unpacking tool with a bundled Ruby runtime for out‑of‑the‑box use on Windows.

Credits
- Original UI logic and inspiration by TAW: https://github.com/taw/etwng/tree/master/ui
- This repo only packages the tooling for convenience and does not claim ownership of the upstream work.

Notes
- A local Ruby runtime is included under `dist/uiunpack_folder/ruby`, so no separate Ruby installation is required to run the packaged binaries.
